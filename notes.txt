when to use SERVER SIDE / CLIENT SIDE COMPONENTS

1. client side whenever using react hooks, interactivity, event listeners, etc.
2. nested routing (post and post/:id)

DATA FETCHING

1. SSR
2. SSG --> static side generation (it will fetch data and cache it also)
3. ISR --> incremental static regeneration --> data to be statically fetched after each defined time slice --> benefits of SSR + SSG

1. GET
